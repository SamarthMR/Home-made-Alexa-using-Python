### About Project 

An alexa-bot also known as a bot, virtual assistant, artificial agent, etc., is basically a software program driven by artificial intelligence principle which serves the purpose of making a conversation with the user by texts or by speech.\
The main objective of this project is to create a bot like Alexa which listens to the person's requests and provide the necessary contents required using Python. This can be done even when you are sitting in your homes and you don't need to spend lot of money to buy an Alexa for your home while you can create an own by yourself..!!\
This bot does not chat with you like a chatbot, but it does communicate to you when you say some commands to it through speech, which can be best seen through some live examples like your Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant etc., this project also works on the same principle.\
This is just a first-level basic type of bot that I've built, it can be further programmed and there is a lot of scope for improvement.

### Workflow

The first step is to import the necessary libraries by installing them into your system. The main libraries required for this project are the following:
1. SpeechRecognition
2. Pyttsx3
3. Pywhatkit
4. PyAudio
5. Pyjokes
6. Wikipedia

#### Installation for Windows users:

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal)

For the bot to listen to our voice/speech
`pip install speechrecognition`

To speak out, or text to speech
`pip install pyttsx3`

For advance control on browser
`pip install pywhatkit`

To get wikipedia data
`pip install wikipedia`

To get funny jokes
`pip install pyjokes`

To communicate with the bot thriugh system microphone or any external microphone
`pip install pipwin`

Then
`pipwin install pyAudio`

Now, you are ready to go and test your Alexa..!!\
Go through the `main.py` source code that I've implemented, and run it in any of your Python interpreters after properly installing all the required libraries.
